# Assetto-Corsa-on-SteamDeck
Assetto Corsa on the Steamdeck is working once again, as you've probably noticed none of the online guides are working, so here is one that works.

This is tested with an up to date SteamOS/Ubuntu, and no major modifications

Assetto Corsa on Linux/Steamdeck

*Working as of 1st October 2023.*

1. Set your deck to writable (lots of guides online, it involves setting a password for your deck)

2. Install Assetto Corsa normally via Game Launcher 

3. Go into desktop mode and run the game, to setup the file structure, the game will crash, let it do so naturally, the setup process will take around 30 minutes from here till the game works

5. Install protonup-QT, and then install proton-GE 7.20, Open your games list and make sure Assetto Corsa is set to proton-GE 7.20

6. Let the game start, it will chug along for 10 minutes or so, as it is installing dependancies, it will crash naturally.

7. Once the game has crashed, run it again, this time it will run for 10 minutes and then the game will open, OR the game might crash again, do not panic, simply let the game run till it crashes then try again.

8. Close the game, and run the game for a third (or final) time, this time the game will install the final batch of dependancies and be ready to play.

9. In Assetto Corsa, go to Settings > General > Force 32-bit mode. Otherwise races won't load properly.

10. Set your controls to Controller instead of Keyboard.

11. Additionally, as things are now the game does not work in gamescope mode. You will have to play it via desktop mode.

12. Mods work and can be installed normally, however as things are now, Content Manager is not working, and I am looking for a way to get it up and running. 

13. Enjoy the best racing sim on the market, once again playable on Deck!
